                <p> <b> <big>Further Explanation:</big></b> </p>
                <p> <b> Implementation:</b> </p>
                <p>Two line sensors are used to control the robot’s movement as it attempts to follow the line.  They are each attached to digital pins on the Arduino, with one initially starting on the white line and the other starting offset to the right on top of the darker material.  We have an initial averaging function that is called in the setup so we can establish threshold values for each sensor.  Once we obtain an average over 10 samples, we set threshold variables that we use for the remainder of the program.  Within the loop, we use conditionals to check when we need to correct to the left or right based on the running average that we continuously update.  With this implementation we successfully followed the white line, but struggled to consistently detect intersections where both sensors were on the white line.  For this reason, we decided to adjust the position of the sensors to make our algorithm more robust in the figure eight pattern. However, we had many issues using the digital sensors as it returned fluctuating and negative values that made it hard to establish a threshold. The solution of this problem was that the ISR was gotten rid of entirely because it didn’t work correctly (discussed more later). This implementation traced the line a little more reliably than the last, and turned at the intersections.</p>
                <p>In our final implementation we were able to establish stable thresholds and readings from the line sensors, allowing us to consistently correct and turn at intersections.  This was achieved with our improved digital pin readings (explained in section below).  Within our loop, we have simple conditional statements to check when either threshold is too low, or if both thresholds of the sensors are too low. After slightly adjusting delay times and speeds of the servo motors, we successfully made the robot drive in a figure eight pattern.</p>  
                <p> <b>Error and Solution to the ISR Sensor Implementation Problem:</b> </p>
                <p>Using a digital line sensor created many difficulties in the milestone. The first way the digital sensors were read was using an ISR that was triggered by new input, with each sensor connected to a digital pin. In the ISR, the sensor was read using the built-in micros() function, which measures microseconds since the arduino began running the current program with 4 microsecond precision. When both sensors were on the white line and too close, some type of error was encountered that resulted in negative numbers being read. The way in which the error was corrected was to use a different measurement system after debugging this issue for over an hour with the help of a TA with no improvements. </p>
                <p>The improved reading method is to use a function to set the “out” pin to an output, drive it high, then waits 10 microseconds and the pin is changed to an input. The function will return how many microseconds the pin was high for, between 0 and 3000 microseconds, with 4 microsecond precision. It was determined when the sensors were on the line or not by the use of a threshold value. If either sensor was above its threshold value then it would be determined that said sensor was off of the white line. The thresholds were tested using simple if statement conditionals which proved to be more accurate than while loops that were in a previous implementation.</p>
